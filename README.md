# SharkTrack
SharkTrack is a vehicle telemetry and performance analysis system built to collect real-time driving data such as speed, acceleration, and braking, then analyze it to give drivers insights into performance and areas for improvement on the track.


Why I Built SharkTrack
---------------------->

  As a car enthusiast who does sim racing, kart racing, and everyday driving, I’ve always been interested in understanding why a lap was fast or slow — not just the final time.
Most telemetry tools are either too expensive, too complex, or locked behind proprietary systems. I wanted something that was affordable, flexible, and built by someone who actually drives.
I built SharkTrack to bridge the gap between simulation racing and real-world driving by using real vehicle data to analyze performance. The goal is to help drivers identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement in braking, acceleration, cornering, and consistency. SharkTrack is designed to grow from a personal project into a real-world telemetry system that drivers can use on track, in karting, or even to better understand their daily driving habits
